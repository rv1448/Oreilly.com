I'm an existing DCU member since 2014 and On or around March 3rd 2020 i applied for an auto loan 
(on my chevy camero 2014 model). 
Once i received notification from lending department that i need to upload documents, 
i spoke to a representative on 03/17/2020 to upload all or any documents(reference num 3673771). 
As part of the call i requested the representative to setup autopayments for this new loan, since there was an already recurring payments being deposited into my DCU account from BOFA account. 
And the representative acknowledged that auto payments to the loan are scheduled and that she took take care of it. 
But i realized that in june of 2020 i was due 2 payments and the autopayment was not setup correctly. 
i called DCU and immediately paid the due amount over the phone, and my account had more then $1500 in balance on that day.
This is a mistake done by first representative not setting up the autopayments correctly, If you search my bank balances you would more than 2000 dollars in my DCU account. 
This miss payment had adversely affected my credit score(my credit score went down to 600) and its impacting my intreset rates for a new home that i'm about to close on Jan 28th 2021, and this is all due to a mistake i never did. Can you please erase this miss payment and provide a letter so i can get my new home closing done. 
I have been a long consumer to DCU never missed payments and always paid more than the loan minimum monthly payment.
